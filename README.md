Roblox Chat Beta 1.2
==============

Download current compiled version: http://www.filedropper.com/robloxchatbeta12<br>
An external program that uses the ROBLOX chat system. This is still in beta, so expect some bugs.<br><br>
<b>Note to admins</b><br>
If you have any problems with this existing (such as it requiring a username and password), please send me a message and I will take down all links to it immediately. I've also given hockeychaos (who I've seen editing the CoreScripts repository quite often) completely access to this. I'm assuming that he works for you, so if you feel like it you can make changes through him.
