Roblox Chat Beta 1.2
==============

<b>Note to admins</b><br>
If you have any problems with this existing (such as it requiring a username and password), please send me a message and I will take down all links to it immediately. I've given hockeychaos (who I've seen editing the CoreScripts repository quite often) completely access to this. I'm assuming that he works for you, so if you want this down extremely quick you can do so through him.<br><br>

An external program that uses the ROBLOX chat system. This is still in beta, so expect some bugs.
